##Usage
This is the REST format for the MorTeam server. It can be used to create or improve upon clients that wish to use MorTeam as their backend.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. While the user is logged in, all requests have a req.user object that contains the logged-in userâ€™s info (minus password).
2. For brevity, self explanatory parameters will be replaced with "SE"
